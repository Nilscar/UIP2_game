Designed and developed a platform game in Processing, inspired by classic titles like Super Mario. 
In this game, players control a zombie character driven by a sense of justice and environmental activism. 
Outraged by the destruction humans have caused, the zombie sets out on a journey to restore balance and protect the world. 
The project involved creating level designs, character animations, and gameplay mechanics to deliver a fun, immersive experience.
