This game was created by Nils Carlberg and Per-Emil Fred√©n during the course User Interface 2. Both has approximatley spent 60 hours on this project.

The game idea was to create an easy platforming game, inspired by pixal art games and old school platform games in terms of graphical design and game features.
In this project Processing 4.0 was used to write the code in Java programming language. The package mimin was installed in order to enable the sound in the game. In other terms Processing 4.0 along with the package mimin is required in order to run the game.

The sounds and images were collected from different open source libaries. The images were mostly collected from the site kenney.nl.

If you have Windows:
To start the game you only need to open the folder named windows and run the exe file.

We have not been able to export the application to mac like we did windows but you can still play the game by opening the files in processing and then installing the minim library from the "Sketch" section and then running the game via processing.

Remaning bugs: A screen bug apeared where it dosent redraw the background image early enogh. small bugs with the ladder is still apparent.
